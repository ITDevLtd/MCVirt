MCVirt - Managed Consistent Virtualisation
======

MCVirt ``(em-see-vert)`` - Command line virtual machine management utility.

Description
===========

MCVirt is a utility for managing virtual machines, supporting the following technologies:

* `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server>`_.
* `KVM virtualisation <http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page>`_.
* Clustering with optional `DRBD <http://drbd.linbit.com/>`_ support.

MCVirt is implemented in Python, using the `libvirt virtualisation library <http://libvirt.org>`_.

BETA WARNING
============
The master branch currently contains a beta release of v9.0.0.

To use the latest stable release, please switch to tag v8.3.0.

Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

MCVirt must currently be built from source into a deb package, using the build script. The package and dependencies can then be installed::

  $ ./build.sh
  $ sudo dpkg -i mcvirt_*_all.deb
  $ sudo apt-get -f install

See the `installation guide <Documentation/Installation.rst>`_ for other dependencies and system configuration.

Configuration
-------------

Start the MCVirt nameserver and daemon by running::

  $ sudo service mcvirt-ns start
  $ sudo service mcvirtd start

Most commands require a username and password to the MCVirt daemon. During installation a superuser is created with username ``mjc`` and password ``pass`` - see `permissions <Documentation/Permissions.rst>`_ for information on creating new users.

Configure the volume group that MCVirt will use to store virtual machine data::

  $ mcvirt node --set-vm-vg <Volume Group>

See the `configuration guide <Documentation/Configuration.rst>`_ for further node configuration steps.

Usage
-----

Create a VM::

  $ mcvirt create --cpu-count 1 --memory 512 --disk-size 8000 test-vm

See the `create/remove VMs <Documentation/CreateRemoveVMs.rst>`_, `cluster <Documentation/Cluster.rst>`_, `permissions <Documentation/Permissions.rst>`_ and `modifying VMs <Documentation/ModifyingVMs.rst>`_ guides for further administrative instructions.

Start the VM::

  $ mcvirt start test-vm

See the `controlling VMs guide <Documentation/ControllingVMs.rst>`_ for further user instructions.

**Note:** Username and password can be provided on the command line with the ``--username`` and ``--password`` options to instead of typing them in after every command.

Development
-----------

For information on developing on MCVirt, see the `development documentation <Documentation/Development.rst>`_.
