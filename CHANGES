* Implemented online-migration, adding the ability to migrate DRBD-backed VMs between nodes, whilst the VM is running.
* Fixed output after a VM is added, to return the name of the ISO, instead of the object.
* Fixed exception, which was thrown whilst attempting to remove an ISO on a node within a cluster, where VMs were registered on the remote node.
* Implemented bash-completion.
* Added default libvirt network to default MCVirt configuration, to allow it be removed/managed through MCVirt.
* Updated documentation to provide use-case based information and information about configuring 'sudo' for MCVirt.
* Fixed issues around file permissions on remote node configuration in git-backed configuration clusters.
* Added ability to configure the VM storage volume group, cluster IP address and superusers through MCVirt directly.

# 2.2.2

* Implemented functionality to reset VMs.

* Updated cache mode for DRBD-backed disk from 'directsync' to 'writeback', to fix issues around DRBD synchronisation.

# 2.2.1

* Fixed issue around creation of DRBD volumes, as large volumes could cause nodes to become unresponsive, as 'dd' (used to wipe the backing logical volumes before use) would consume all available RAM.
* Fixed issues around adding an ISO from a URL.

# 2.2.0

* Fixed issues with permissions on the MCVirt configuration directory, which caused issues whilst attaching ISOs to VMs.
* Fixed default storage type on single-node instances of MCVirt, which caused an exception if it was not specified.
* Implemented DRBD status, which provides the status/configuration for all MCVirt-configured DRBD volumes on the node.
* Implemented functionality to list the networks present on the node.

# 2.1.0

* Switched graphic driver from 'cirrus' to 'vmvga', which increases graphics support among Linux distributions.
* Implemented functionality to support adding ISOs to MCVirt nodes, either from a path or URL, as well as listing the present ISOs.
* Switched VM HDD caching from 'none' to 'directsync', to improve performance.

# 2.0.2

* Fixed various issues around DRBD verification.
* Enabled redirection of mcvirt-drbd.py output to syslog, instead of discarding it.
* Updated debian dependencies to require libvirt-bin.

# 2.0.1

* Fixed issue around exceptions when performing commands as a non-superuser.

# 2.0.0

* Fixed build scrip to always specify the last tag and to always provide the git commit SHA ID.
* Fixed bug where MCVirt was unable to create the base configuration directory.
* Fixed bug around class name in DRBD enabling functionality.
* Added functionality to be able to migrate VMs away from a failed node, whilst the node is offline.

# 1.0.0

* Converted MCVirt project for use with Git/GitHub.
* Made MCVirt open source, under GPLv2 license.
* Updated MCVirt to conform to PEP8 coding standards
* Added epilog and description to parser output.
* Fixed bug in conversion between integer and string, which caused errors after re-registering/migration a VM after the memory allocation/CPU count had been updated after creation.
* Added ability for superusers to 'ignore cluster', so that commands may be run whilst a node in the cluster is offline.
* Fixed debian package dependencies.
* Fixed race-condition in DRBD verification.

# 0.10
